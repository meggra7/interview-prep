# Comment System

## Prompt

Let's build a comment system!  Your solution will only hold comments on one "thing".

## Requirements

We should be able to:

- Add new comments
- Retrieve comments by creation date, either ascending or descending order
- Add replies to comments. In other words, comments that come in can have a parent comment!
- Retrieve comments by creation date, always in order from from oldest to newest. Note that replies should not appear on their own in the main listing, but should only ever be returned as part of their parent comment.

## Optional improvements

- Modify comments and/or replies
- Delete comments and/or replies
