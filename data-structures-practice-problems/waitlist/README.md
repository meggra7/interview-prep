# Waitlist

## Prompt

Today we're building a waitlist application for a tech support location!  When customers arrive, they'll sign in on an iPad, and then they'll be called up to the register in the order in which they arrived. 

Well, almost! Some of our customers pay good money for a premium support plan, and they should be given priority.

## Requirements

The app should allow us to:

- Sign in a customer with their name, and specify if they're on a premium plan.
- Get the name of the next customer to call up. Remember! Premium first, standard thereafter, and otherwise by arrival time.
- Find out how many customers are still waiting so that we can turn off sign-in when there are more customers than we can serve beore closing.
